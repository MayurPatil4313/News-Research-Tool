      "SpaceX Starlink has been on a satellite launch spree lately. Last week, the Elon Musk-owned company successfully sent 24 Starlink satellites on a Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenbueg Space Force base, and now it is planning to add 28 more satellites to its constellation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new batch of satellites, which are part of Starlink‚Äôs 10-26 mission, will be joining the existing 8,000-plus Starlink satellites that are already placed in Earth‚Äôs low orbit. The flight comes after Starlink suffered a two-plus-hour global outage, which it said was because of a software glitch. For those wondering, the lift off is scheduled at 1:31 PM IST. You can watch the live stream in the video below or from SpaceX‚Äôs website.\n",

      "According to Spaceflightnow, the 45th Weather Squadron said that there is a 95 per cent chance for favourable weather conditions during the launch window, which means that the launch may not be delayed due to bad weather.\n",

      "The Falcon 9 first stage booster that‚Äôs being used for the Starlink 10-26 mission was previously used to launch 17 batches of Starlink satellites and is being used for the 22nd time. Almost eight minutes after launch, the booster will land on the droneship named ‚ÄúA Shortfall of Gravitas‚Äù located in the Atlantic Ocean. If the touchdown is successful, this will be the 119th time the vessel has recaptured a booster and the 480th booster landing for SpaceX. The company started beta testing of Starlink back in 2020, and since then, the satellite internet service has expanded to over 115 countries.\n",
